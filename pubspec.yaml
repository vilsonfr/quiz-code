  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/TELA01/botao_01.png
    - assets/TELA02/botao_02.png 
    - assets/TELA03/botao_03.png
    - assets/Fundo.png
    - assets/LOGO_01.png
    - assets/PIN_FUNDO.png
    - assets/ALAMIDIA_LOGO.svg
    - assets/ALAMIDIA_LOGO.png
    - assets/.env
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
